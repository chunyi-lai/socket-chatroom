# Socket Based Chatroom

## This is a mini project. It is currently still in the early stage of development.

In this project, a client-server model of a chatroom is created.
The user can interact with the client application on a terminal. The user will
be able to:
    * create a chatroom
    * join an existing chatroom
    * send messages in a chatroom
    * read messages in the chatroom

By interacting with the client service on a terminal, all related information will
be sent back and forth from the server through socket. The server is mainly wriiten in
Java and the client is mainly written in Python.
